# Description: This program asks the user for the company name
# and how many feet of cable they want to install.
# Then it calculates the total cost based on how many feet they ask for.

# Print welcome message
print("Welcome to the Fiber Installation Program!")

# Retrieve the company name from the user

    # Check if the entered feet is a valid positive number
    if feet <= 0:
        print("Error: Please enter a positive number of feet for installation.")
